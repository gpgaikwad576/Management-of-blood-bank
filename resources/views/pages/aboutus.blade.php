    <h2>The Importance of Blood Donation  </h2>
<p >
Every year an estimated 6.8 million people in the United States donate blood and 4.5 million will need a blood transfusion. At Moffitt Cancer Center, blood transfusions are a daily occurrence. Since blood cannot be created in a laboratory and there are no substitutes, cancer patients depend solely on donations.



Last year, Moffitt conducted 15,699 red blood cell transfusions and 11,621 platelet transfusions. Cancer patients are in a consistent need for blood for many reasons - loss of blood during surgery, low blood count due to the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, or anemia, which can be caused by the disease itself. Cancers in the blood and bone marrow, such as leukemia and lymphoma, are another reason for a transfusion because the disease does not allow the body to produce normal blood-making cells.</p>

<h3>Types of Blood Donations</h3>
<p>
There are several types of blood donations and one donor can help up to three patients.

A single unit of blood can be separated into different components such as red blood cells, plasma and platelets.

Whole Blood is the most common and most flexible blood donation. It is usually collected in one pint and used to help multiple patients, by being separated into different components.

Plasma is collected through apheresis, which is the process that separates plasma from other blood components. It has blood clotting factors needed to help trauma patients and those battling certain diseases like cancer.
